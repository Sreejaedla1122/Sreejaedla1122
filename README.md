## About Me (Technical)
I’m a software engineer focused on building **reliable, scalable backend systems** and **data/streaming pipelines**. I work across the full SDLC—design, implementation, testing, observability, and production support—with an emphasis on **performance**, **fault-tolerance**, and **clean APIs**.

**Core focus areas**
- **Backend Engineering:** REST APIs, microservices, authentication/authorization, system design
- **Distributed Systems:** event-driven architectures, streaming, backpressure, idempotency, retries
- **Data Engineering:** ingestion pipelines, schema validation, SQL optimization, batch vs streaming
- **Cloud + DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, deployment automation, monitoring

---

## Core Skills (ATS / Keywords)
**Languages:** Python, Java, C++, C#, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript  
**Backend:** Spring Boot, FastAPI, REST, JSON, OAuth/JWT, API versioning, pagination, rate limiting  
**Data/Streaming:** Kafka, Spark, Spark Streaming, ETL/ELT, data validation, partitioning, watermarking  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB (indexing, query tuning, stored procedures)  
**Cloud:** AWS (S3, Lambda, EC2, Athena), Azure (Data Factory)  
**DevOps/Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Git, SonarQube, Postman, Linux, Agile/Scrum  
**Security/Quality:** TLS, encryption concepts, secure APIs, unit/integration testing, logging/monitoring

---

## What I Build
- **High-throughput REST services** with consistent error contracts, observability, and test coverage  
- **Streaming pipelines** (Kafka + Spark Streaming) for near real-time analytics  
- **Data pipelines** with validation, deduplication, idempotent writes, and performance tuning  
- **Cloud deployments** using Docker/K8s with CI/CD automation

## Experience (Technical Impact)

### Software Engineer — Fraud / Risk Systems
- Built **Python + SQL** ingestion + preprocessing pipelines with schema validation and structured logging
- Delivered **FastAPI** inference services containerized with **Docker**, enabling repeatable deployments
- Improved pipeline performance by optimizing SQL access patterns (indexes, query refactors, batching)
- Added resilience patterns: retries, timeouts, and safe fallbacks to reduce runtime failures

### Software Engineer — Streaming / Microservices
- Implemented **Kafka + Spark Streaming** flows for high-volume event processing (windowing, partitioning)
- Designed and maintained **REST APIs** with standardized contracts (status codes, error payloads, versioning)
- Automated build/release pipelines via **Jenkins**, containerized services, and deployed to **Kubernetes**
- Tuned database performance by reducing heavy queries and improving stored procedures / indexing strategy
- Migrated legacy components toward **cloud-ready** microservices patterns (stateless services, config mgmt)

## Engineering Principles
- Write maintainable code with **clear interfaces** and **testable design**
- Prefer **observability by default** (structured logs, metrics, traces where applicable)
- Build for failure: **idempotency**, retries, timeouts, circuit breakers (when needed)
- Optimize with evidence: profiling, metrics, query plans, and load tests
